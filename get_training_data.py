The text states that although members of the Igun Eronmwon guild typically do something with techniques that have been passed down since the thirteenth century, they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t strictly observe every tradition.&rdquo; By establishing a contrast with not always following traditions, the context suggests that guild members do typically adhere to traditional techniques. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context &ldquo;experiment with&rdquo; would mean to do something new with. Although using motors rather than manual bellows is presented as a new approach, the text establishes a contrast between what the guild members typically do with techniques that have been passed down over centuries and the idea that the members &ldquo;don&rsquo;t strictly observe every tradition.&rdquo; The phrase &ldquo;experiment with&rdquo; wouldn&rsquo;t support the contrast because regularly trying new things with the techniques would be an example of not strictly following all traditions.
